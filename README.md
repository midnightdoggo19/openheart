# Open Heart

**Open Heart is a simple mod that allows the player to locate any block in the world.** You can do this by typing<br /> `/locateblock`, followed by the name of the block you're looking for. We'll do a quick little search and let you know the coordinates you're looking for!
<br />This is a *Fabric-only* mod supporting versions 1.21 through 1.21.8, with plans to expand into the known universe.
<br /><br /><br />
Here is a very sad table:
|      | Fabric |
|------|--------|
|1.21.* | âœ…      |
