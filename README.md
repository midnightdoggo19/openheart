**Open Heart allows the player to locate any block in the world.** You can do this by typing `/locateblock`, followed by the name of the block you're looking for (grass_block, air, cobbled_deepslate). We'll do a quick little search and let you know the coordinates of the block you've requested!

<br />This is a *Fabric-only* mod supporting versions 1.21 through 1.21.8, with plans to expand into the known universe. It needs only to be installed on the client side; there's no server functionality just yet. This mods requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) to run.

Currently supported versions/mod loaders:
